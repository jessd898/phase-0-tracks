# Virus Predictor

# I worked on this challenge [by myself, with: ].
# We spent [#] hours on this challenge.

# EXPLANATION OF require_relative
# Require_relative here is inside looking to the state_data related file. This is similar to HTML and CSS when we link the two files. 
# Require will look up outside of the local files to gems (rspec is an example here). 
require_relative 'state_data'

  #keeps only this method private but it still runs when public so not sure why it needs to be private. It does not run if you move above virus_effects

#Iterate over, each state is a new instance of the VirusPredictor class. Make sure you know what they block parameters are for both key and value(print test!).

# Reflection Section

# State is a string and pop_var are symbols, differences are the string has the "" and =>
# Require_relative here is inside looking to the state_data related file. This is similar to HTML and CSS when we link the two files. 
# Require will look up outside of the local files to gems (rspec is an example here). 
# Iterate over, each state is a new instance of the VirusPredictor class. Make sure you know what they block parameters are for both key and value(print test!). 
# We don't see a way to refactor here for the variables. 
# Identify the constant variable of STATE_DATA and making this DRY. Being able to iterate through structure and create new instances of the Virus Predictor class.
