# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
    Version control is important because it allows multiple people to work on the same project on different issues. Also if someone makes a mistake you can roll back to a previous version. 
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
    A branch is a copy of your project that you made off of the master branch. You can make different branches depending on what you want to work on. 
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
    A commit is when you make a significant change and then you write a message to yourself regarding what the change was so that you or someone else knows what you did. Commit often! A good commit is something that is clear and concise. 
* What is a merge conflict?
    Merge conflict is when you have the same file in two branches that have conflicting changes.
